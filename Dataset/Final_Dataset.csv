It attaches to the site at which it formed and remains there, hindering blood flow.A blood clot is usually a normal physical response to injury.

It quickly forms a plug that can reduce or prevent bleeding. However, a thrombus can cause severe health problems, as it interrupts the function of a blood vessel.

A section of a blood clot that breaks free from the thrombus and circulates in the bloodstream is called an embolus.

An embolus moves through the vascular system until it lodges in a different part of the body.

An embolus is a dangerous and potentially fatal complication of thrombosis. It is especially dangerous if it reaches the heart, lungs, or brain (embolism).
Clotting occurs due to a series of chemical reactions between blood cells known as platelets and proteins called clotting factors.

When a person is in good health, the body regulates the clotting process according to its needs.

Sometimes, your body confuses normal, healthy cells for invading cells. This is called an autoimmune response. If the autoimmune response isn’t regulated or treated, your immune system can attack healthy tissues. This can cause serious medical issues, including conditions like hypothyroidism.

ileus,"abscess bacterial,abdomen acute,air fluid level,catching breath,abdominal tenderness,nausea,sore to touch,flatulence,diarrhea,mass of body structure,apyrexial,constipation,thicken,gravida 0,pain abdominal","Your intestines are about 28 feet long. This means the foods you eat have a long way to travel before they’re fully digested or excreted. An ileus is common after surgery because people are often prescribed medication that can slow intestinal movement. This is a type of paralytic ileus.

In this instance, the intestine isn’t blocked. Rather, it isn’t moving properly.

The result is little or no movement of digested food through your intestines.

Examples of medicines that can cause a paralytic ileus include:

hydromorphone (Dilaudid)
morphine
oxycodone
tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline and imipramine (Tofranil)
However, there are several other causes of an ileus. These include:

intestinal cancer
Crohn’s disease, which causes the intestinal walls to get thicker due to autoimmune inflammation
diverticulitis
Parkinson’s disease, which affects muscles and nerves in the intestines
These are the most common ileus causes in adults. Children can also have an ileus.

Intussusception is the most common cause for an ileus in children. This is when a part of the intestine “telescopes” or slides into itself.


Risk factors for ileus
Ileus is the second most common reason for hospital readmission in the first 30 days after surgery. An ileus is more likely if you’ve recently had abdominal surgery.

Surgical procedures on the abdomen that involve handling the intestines commonly cause stoppage of intestinal movement for a period of time. This allows the surgeon to access your intestines.

Sometimes normal peristalsis can be slow to return. Other people are more likely to experience later scar tissue formation that can also lead to an ileus.

A number of medical conditions can increase your risk of ileus. They include:

electrolyte imbalance, such as those involving potassium and calcium
history of intestinal injury or trauma
history of intestinal disorder, such as Crohn’s disease and diverticulitis
sepsis
history of irradiation of or near the abdomen
peripheral artery disease
rapid weight loss
Aging also naturally slows down how fast the intestines move. An older adult is at greater risk for ileus, especially since they tend to take more medications that could potentially slow movement of material through the intestines.

How is an ileus diagnosed?
A doctor would first listen to a description of your symptoms. You’ll likely be asked about any history of medical conditions, prescribed medications, and surgeries, especially recent procedures.

Your doctor will then conduct a physical exam, looking at your abdomen for signs of swelling or tightness. Your doctor will also listen to your abdomen for typical bowel sounds with a stethoscope.

If your bowels aren’t moving because of an ileus, your doctor may not hear anything, or may hear excessive bowel sounds.

Imaging studies are usually ordered after a thorough physical exam. A doctor may use these methods to identify areas where bowel content seems to be concentrated.

Imaging studies can show where an ileus is located, likely showing a buildup of gas, an enlarged intestine, or even obstruction.

Examples of imaging studies include:

Plain film X-ray. This may show signs of trapped gas and possibly the obstruction, but plain film X-rays aren’t always the most conclusive way to diagnose an ileus.
CT scan. This scan provides more detailed X-ray images to help doctors identify the potential area where the ileus is located. The scan typically uses contrast agents injected intravenously or taken orally.
Ultrasound. This imaging technique is more commonly used to identify an ileus in children.
In some instances, a doctor may use a diagnostic procedure known as an air or barium enema.

A doctor will insert air or barium sulfate, a radioopaque substance, through the rectum into the colon, while a technician takes X-rays of the abdomen. The air or barium shows up on the X-ray to help the technician view any potential obstruction.

In some children, this procedure can treat an ileus that is caused by intussusception.

What complications can an ileus cause?
An ileus can develop into a serious and potentially life-threatening situation.

Two of the most severe complications are:

Necrosis
Also known as untimely cellular death or dead tissue, necrosis can happen when an obstruction cuts off blood supply to the intestine.

Without blood, oxygen can’t get the tissue, causing it to die. Dead tissue weakens the intestinal wall. This makes it easy for the intestine to tear and leak bowel contents.

This is known a bowel perforation.

Peritonitis
The bowel perforation mentioned earlier can cause peritonitis.

This is a serious inflammation in the abdominal cavity caused by bacteria or fungus.

Your bowel contains many bacteria, like E. coli. They’re supposed to remain in your intestines, not roam free in your body cavity. Bacterial peritonitis can turn into sepsis, a life-threatening condition that can result in shock and organ failure.

How is an ileus treated?
Treatments for an ileus depends on its severity. Examples include:

Partial obstruction
Sometimes a condition like Crohn’s disease or diverticulitis will mean that part of the intestine isn’t moving. But some bowel material can get through.

In this instance, if you are otherwise stable, a doctor may recommend a low-fiber diet. This can help reduce the bulky stool, making it easier to pass.

However, if that doesn’t work, surgery to repair or move the affected portion of the bowel may be needed.

Complete obstruction
A complete obstruction is a medical emergency.

Treatment will depend upon your overall health. For example, some people can’t handle an extensive abdominal surgery. This includes the very elderly and those with colon cancer.

In this case, a doctor may use a metal stent to make the intestine more open. Ideally, food will start to pass with the stent.

Abdominal surgery to remove the blockage or the damaged intestine portion may still be needed though.

Paralytic ileus
Treatment for a paralytic ileus starts by identifying the underlying cause.

If medicine is the cause, a doctor may be able to prescribe another medication to stimulate motility (intestine movement). An example is metoclopramide (Reglan).

Discontinuing the medications that caused the ileus, if possible, can also help. However, you shouldn’t stop taking a medicine, especially an antidepressant, without your doctor’s approval.

Treatment without surgery is possible during the early stages of paralytic ileus. But you may still require a hospital stay to get the proper fluids until the issue is fully resolved.

A doctor may also use a nasogastric tube with suctioning, in addition to giving intravenous fluid hydration. Known as nasogastric decompression, this procedure calls for a tube to be inserted into your nasal cavity to reach your stomach.

Essentially the tube suctions out the extra air and material that you may otherwise vomit.

Most surgery-related ileus will resolve within two to four days after surgery. However, some people do require surgery for correction if the condition doesn’t improve.

Considerations for surgery
Your intestines are very long, so you can live without a portion of it. While it may affect the digestive process, most people do live a healthy life with a part of their intestine removed.

In some instances, a doctor may have to remove the entire intestine. In this case, a doctor will create a special pouch called an ostomy. The bag allows stool to drain from your remaining gastrointestinal tract.

You have to care for the ostomy, but you can live without your intestine after an ileus.

Outlook for ileus
An ileus is common, but it’s highly treatable.

If you’ve had a recent surgery or have other risk factors for an ileus you should be aware of the symptoms.

Seeking medical care is important in the hopes the ileus can be resolved without invasive medical treatment.

Can an ileus be prevented?
Most of the risk factors associated with ileus aren’t preventable. Examples include an injury or chronic illness.

If surgery is necessary, the possibility for ileus should be considered. But it shouldn’t keep you from having a needed surgery.

Being aware of the symptoms of an ileus are important in seeking prompt treatment to keep it from getting worse.

Your intestines complete this task by moving in a wave-like motion. Known as peristalsis, these muscle contractions move forward your digested food.

However, if something such as muscle or nerve problems, slows down or blocks this motion, the result can be a major traffic jam in your intestines.

Ileus is the medical term for this lack of movement somewhere in the intestines that leads to a buildup and potential blockage of food material.

An ileus can lead to an intestinal obstruction. This means no food material, gas, or liquids can get through.

It can occur as a side effect after surgery. However, there are other causes of this condition.

An ileus is a serious concern. But people often don’t know that food is building up in their intestines and continue to eat. This pushes more and more material toward the buildup.

Without treatment, the ileus can perforate or tear the intestine. This causes bowel contents — which have high levels of bacteria — to leak into areas of your body cavity. This can be deadly.

If an ileus does occur, it’s important to get treatment as quickly as possible.",

infection,"fever,erythema,decreased translucency,hepatosplenomegaly,chill,pruritus,diarrhea,abscess bacterial,swelling,pain,apyrexial,cough","The invasion and multiplication of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites that are not normally present within the body. An infection may cause no symptoms and be subclinical, or it may cause symptoms and be clinically apparent. An infection may remain localized, or it may spread through the blood or lymphatic vessels to become systemic (bodywide). Microorganisms that live naturally in the body are not considered infections. For example, bacteria that normally live within the mouth and intestine are not infections. An infection occurs when another organism enters your body and causes disease. The organisms that cause infections are very diverse and can include things like viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. You can acquire an infection in many different ways, such as directly from a person with an infection, via contaminated food or water, and even through the bite of an insect. Let’s take a closer look at infections, the types of organisms that cause them, and actions you can take to help prevent becoming ill.You can get an infection in many different ways. Direct contact Some, but not all, infections can spread when you come directly into contact with a person who has an infection, whether through touching, kissing, or having sex. Direct contact with the bodily fluids of a person who has an infection can also spread infections in some instances. This can include things like:
blood
nasal secretions
saliva
semen
vaginal secretions
Lastly, some infections can be spread directly from an infected mother to her child either through the placenta or during childbirth.
Indirect contact
Some infectious organisms can be found throughout your environment. You can come into contact with these things and then spread the infection to yourself.
A common example of this is when someone with the flu coughs or sneezes. Influenza virus can then be present in the air or on objects such as door and faucet handles. If you touch a contaminated object and then touch your face, mouth, or nose, you may become infected.
Through contaminated food or water
In some cases, food or water may be contaminated with infectious organisms. You can get these infections by consuming things like:

foods prepped or prepared in unsanitary conditions
raw or undercooked foods, such as produce, meats, or seafood
improperly canned foods
unpasteurized milks or juices
foods that have been improperly stored or refrigerated
From an infected animal
Some infections are spread to people from an infected animal. One example is the rabies virus, which you can get if an infected animal bites you.

Another example is toxoplasmosis. You can come down with this parasitic disease from changing an infected cat’s litter box.

From a bug bite
There are many different types of biting bugs, including ticks, mosquitoes, and lice. In some cases, you can get an infection if a bug carrying around an infectious microorganism bites you. Some examples include malaria, Lyme disease, and West Nile Virus.

ALL INFECTIONS ARE DIFFERENT
Not all infections are spread in the same way. While one infection may be transmitted via infected blood, another may be transmitted by the bite of an insect. It’s always important to consider the specific infection when talking about transmission.

Identifying an infection
Some infections have very characteristic symptoms. Your doctor may be able to make a diagnosis based off of these symptoms, your medical history, and a physical examination.

In other cases, it can be hard to determine what type of organism may be causing your condition. For example, some bacterial and viral infections can have very similar symptoms.

In cases where it’s unclear what’s causing your infection, your doctor may take a sample from your body to be tested in a laboratory. Where this sample is collected from depends on your illness and the type of organism suspected. Some sample types can include:

blood
urine
stool
nasal or throat
sputum
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
Your doctor may also use imaging tests, such as an X-ray, CT scan, or MRI scan. In some cases, they may also want to take a biopsy of the affected tissue to examine it.

Preventing infection
There are many actions that you can take to prevent the spread of infections. Be sure to follow the tips below:

Practice good hand hygiene. Wash your hands often, especially before eating or handling food, after using the toilet, and before touching your face or mouth.
Get vaccinated. Many infections can be prevented through vaccines. Examples include, but aren’t limited to: measles, whooping cough, and hepatitis B.
Avoid sharing personal items. These include drinking glasses, toothbrushes, and razor blades.
Practice safe sex.
Cover cuts or scrapes. This can lessen the chances that they’ll become infected. Don’t pick or scratch them.
Use insect repellents or sprays. These products can help you avoid being bitten by mosquitoes or ticks.
Be careful with food. Always prepare food in sanitary conditions, and make sure it’s heated to the proper temperature before eating.
Avoid wild animals. Make sure to have any animal bites examined by a doctor.
Know before you go. If you’re traveling, be aware of any infections common to the area where you’ll be staying. Some of them may even have vaccines available.
Cover your mouth when you cough. If you’re sick, be sure to dispose of all used tissues properly. If you don’t have a tissue, cough into the crook of your elbow instead of your hand.
Stay home if you’re sick. This can prevent you from spreading an infection. Make sure to ask your doctor when you can return to work or school.
The takeaway
Infections can be caused by a variety of different organisms, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. The different ways that you can get an infection can be just as diverse as the organisms that cause them.

While some infections may be treated at home, you should always contact your doctor if you have symptoms of an infection that aren’t getting better, are getting worse, or recur. You may need additional medications to treat your condition.
